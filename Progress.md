# WebServer Project Status Report

*20/03/2025*

## Project Overview

The WebServer project is a C++98 compliant HTTP server implementation that follows the requirements specified in the WebServerSubject.pdf. The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently using non-blocking I/O and supports various HTTP features like static file serving, directory listings, file uploads, and more.

## Current Implementation Status vs. Roadmap

### Phase 1: Configuration Completion ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Configuration file parsing system
- ‚úÖ Server and Location configuration classes
- ‚úÖ Configuration validation
- ‚úÖ Default error pages when not provided
- ‚úÖ Validation for route conflicts
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive configuration error reporting

The configuration system is fully implemented with robust parsing, validation, and default value handling.

### Phase 2: HTTP Server Core ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Socket Management (Socket class)
  - Non-blocking socket configuration
  - Support for multiple ports
- ‚úÖ Server Core (Server class)
  - Initialization and shutdown procedures
  - Signal handling
- ‚úÖ I/O Multiplexing (IOMultiplexer class)
  - Wrapper for poll() with proper non-blocking operations
  - Event loop implementation
- ‚úÖ Connection Management (Connection class)
  - Connection acceptance
  - Timeout handling
  - Connection cleanup

The server core is fully implemented with proper non-blocking I/O, meeting the project's requirements for using only one poll() for all operations.

### Phase 3: HTTP Protocol Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ HTTP Request Parsing (Request class)
  - Method, URI, version parsing
  - HTTP headers parsing
  - Body parsing including chunked encoding
  - Query parameter handling
- ‚úÖ HTTP Response Generation (Response class)
  - Status code handling
  - Header generation
  - Response body creation
- ‚úÖ HTTP Status Codes
  - Complete implementation of required status codes
  - Custom error pages

The HTTP protocol implementation is complete with a robust class structure.

### Phase 4: Request Handlers ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Handler Architecture (integrated into Connection class)
- ‚úÖ GET Method
  - Static file serving
  - Directory indexes
- ‚úÖ POST Method
  - Form data parsing
  - File upload handling framework
- ‚úÖ DELETE Method (basic implementation)
- ‚úÖ Directory Listing
  - HTML generation for directory contents
  - Support for toggling via configuration

Request handlers are implemented but some advanced functionality is still in progress.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features üü® PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ CGI Implementation
  - Environment variable setup according to CGI/1.1 spec
  - Process creation with fork() and pipe()
  - Non-blocking I/O for CGI communication
  - CGI output parsing and response generation
  - Full implementation of required CGI functionality
- üü® File Upload Handling (parsing works, storage not implemented)
- ‚úÖ HTTP Redirects

CGI implementation is now complete. File upload handling still requires the actual storage implementation.

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Unit Testing for configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration Testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stress Testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser Compatibility Testing

Testing is partially complete, with comprehensive tests for the configuration system.

### Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Code Documentation
- ‚úÖ Architecture Documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Optimization

Documentation is extensive, but performance optimization might need more work.

## Latest Changes

### CGI Implementation Completion

A significant advancement has been made with the implementation of the CGI functionality:

1. **CGIHandler Class**
   - Created dedicated class to encapsulate CGI functionality
   - Implemented proper process creation using fork() and execve()
   - Set up pipe-based communication between server and CGI scripts

2. **Environment Variable Setup**
   - Full implementation of CGI/1.1 environment variables
   - Conversion of HTTP headers to CGI variables
   - Support for PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING, and other CGI requirements

3. **Non-blocking I/O Operations**
   - Ensured all CGI I/O operations are non-blocking
   - Implemented proper error handling for CGI processes
   - Added timeout handling for CGI execution

4. **CGI Response Processing**
   - Implemented parsing of CGI output headers
   - Support for CGI-specific headers like Status
   - Proper generation of HTTP responses from CGI output

5. **Connection Integration**
   - Updated Connection::_handleCgi method to use the new CGIHandler
   - Proper detection of CGI scripts based on file extensions
   - Integration with both GET and POST methods

## Outstanding Tasks

1. **File Operations**
   - File upload storage implementation
   - Actual file deletion for DELETE method

2. **Testing**
   - Integration testing with real browsers
   - Stress testing for multiple connections
   - Edge case handling

3. **Performance Tuning**
   - Optimize for high connection loads
   - Memory usage optimization

## Compliance with Project Requirements

The implementation strictly adheres to the WebServer project requirements:

- ‚úÖ Non-blocking I/O for all operations
- ‚úÖ Single poll() call for all I/O operations
- ‚úÖ No read/write without going through poll()
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple server configurations
- ‚úÖ GET, POST, DELETE methods support
- ‚úÖ Directory listing
- ‚úÖ Custom error pages
- ‚úÖ HTTP redirection
- ‚úÖ CGI execution support
- ‚úÖ C++98 compliance

## Conclusion

The WebServer project has made significant progress, with most core functionality now implemented. The recent CGI implementation completes a major component required by the project specifications.

The main outstanding tasks are the file upload storage implementation, actual file deletion for DELETE requests, and comprehensive testing. With these components completed, the project will fully satisfy all requirements specified in the subject.
