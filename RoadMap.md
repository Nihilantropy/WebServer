# CGI Implementation Roadmap

## Critical Issues

- [ ] **Fix Error Propagation**
  - Fix the bug where CGI execution errors aren't properly reflected in return values
  - Ensure error messages are logged correctly
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes for CGI failures

- [ ] **Implement Multi-Interpreter Support**
  - Add configuration syntax for mapping file extensions to interpreters
  - Update `LocationConfig` to support new syntax: `cgi_handler .php:/usr/bin/php-cgi .py:/usr/bin/python .sh:/bin/sh`
  - Modify CGIHandler to select the correct interpreter based on file extension
  - Update parser to handle the new directive

## Security Improvements

- [ ] **Enhance CGI Security**
  - Add timeouts for CGI execution (prevent infinite loops)
  - Implement file type validation and restrictions
  - Add resource limits for CGI processes
  - Validate script path is within allowed directories

- [ ] **Path Resolution**
  - Standardize how CGI paths are resolved relative to server root
  - Add clear validation and error messages for path issues
  - Ensure proper handling of PATH_INFO

## Functionality Enhancements

- [ ] **Improve Error Handling**
  - Create more detailed error responses for CGI failures
  - Add debugging information to server logs
  - Create custom error pages for common CGI issues

- [ ] **Enhanced POST Data Handling**
  - Ensure proper handling of large POST data
  - Implement more robust chunked encoding support for CGI
  - Handle multipart/form-data properly for file uploads to CGI

- [ ] **CGI Output Processing**
  - Add better handling of CGI output formats
  - Support all standard CGI response headers
  - Handle large responses efficiently

## Testing and Documentation

- [ ] **CGI Test Scripts**
  - Create test scripts for PHP, Python, and shell
  - Test with different HTTP methods
  - Test with different content types
  - Test error conditions

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Document CGI configuration options
  - Add examples of CGI usage
  - Include troubleshooting information

## Implementation Order

1. Fix error propagation issues - highest priority
2. Implement multi-interpreter support
3. Enhance security features
4. Improve error handling and path resolution
5. Enhance POST data handling and output processing
6. Create test scripts and documentation
